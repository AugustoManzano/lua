-- Calculates the French Amortization System (Price). In this system, 
-- the benefits are the same and periodic, from the moment they begin 
-- to be paid.
--
-- A loan in the amount of $ 100,000.00 must be settled in 5 equal and 
-- monthly installments, with the first 30 days after the date of 
-- hiring, by means of the French amortization system. Knowing that the
-- interest rate charged is 10% per month, it is asked to express the 
-- value of the benefits to be paid. (TOSI, 2002)
